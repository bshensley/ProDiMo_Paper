1. INTRODUCTION (JJG)
   ---inferred accretion rates of low-mass protostellar disks
   ---current understanding of MRI in these disks
   ---molecular spectra of disks
   ---the goals of this work
   ---outline of paper

2. METHODS (BH)
   ---summary of ProDiMo
   ---implementation of dissipation profile
   ---model parameters
  	    + disk surface density
	    + dust abundance and properties
   	    + stellar UV, etc.
   ---molecular lines included

3. RESULTS
  ---Compare temperature, density, and spectra for several models
  	     0. ISM dust/100, no accretion [baseline model]
	     1. Like model 1, but for full ISM dust
	     2. ISM dust/100, uniform (by mass) viscous heating for Mdot = dex(-8) Msun/yr
	     3. ISM dust/100, Hirose & Turner heating profile for Mdot = dex(-8), dex(-7)

4. DISCUSSION
